Clouds tend to reflect the incoming sunlight so that less radiation arrives at the ground. In a second step the method calculates the solar radiation at clear sky conditions (i.e. no clouds) using the theory of radiative transfer in the atmosphere together with data on how much aerosols (dust, particles, etc.) there are in the atmosphere and the concentration of water vapour and ozone, both of which tend to absorb radiation at particular wavelengths. The total radiation is then calculated from the cloud albedo and the clear-sky irradiance.
