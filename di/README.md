# Data integration for EnerMaps

This service retrieves the different sources to be integrated into the database.

## Dataflows

The data integration is based on forked versions of `dataflows` and `datapackage-py`supporting raster data sources. These versions are cloned and installed via the Dockerfile.

## Work in progress

- Test of pipeline using NEWA data

- Upload to the frontend via POST API (still testing)

- Upload to the DB (TBD)
