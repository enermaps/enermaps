# Database for the EnerMaps project

We use postgresql with PostGIS. The initial empty database schema can be found in `db/init/add_dataset_db.sql`.

The sql schema will be loaded only if the `db-data` volume is not already present.
As a reminder, you would need to execute a `docker-compose down --volumes` before running the app to load the schema and start from an empty db.

You can have an interactive session connected to psql with:

```
docker exec -it enermaps_db_1 psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U test dataset
```

## Sample queries

- Vector dataset, e.g `ds_id = 2`

```sql
SELECT data.fid,
		json_object_agg(variable, value),
		fields,
		start_at, dt, z, data.ds_id, metadata, geometry
       FROM data
INNER JOIN spatial ON data.fid = spatial.fid
INNER JOIN datasets ON data.ds_id = datasets.ds_id
WHERE data.ds_id = 2
GROUP BY data.fid, start_at, dt, z, data.ds_id, fields, geometry, metadata
ORDER BY data.fid;
```

The pivoted table (variables + values to display on the map) is encapsulated as JSON in the `json_object_agg` column.


- Administrative units, here with `levl_code = NUTS1`

```sql
SELECT * FROM spatial WHERE "levl_code" = 'NUTS1';
```

- Raster dataset, e.g. `ds_id = 43`
The same query as for a vector dataset can be used. The name of the raster file to be loaded is set in the `FID` field. The complete path of each raster file can be constructed as follows:
`di/data/{ds_id}/{FID}`


## Backup

To create a dump file, you can run this command:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-db.yml exec db sh -c "pg_dump -U test -h localhost -p 5432 dataset -FC > /db-backup/enermaps.dump"
```
The dump file will be created in the main folder in your host machine.

This is useful to have a dump file created with a version of `pg_dump` that corresponds to the one running in the docker container.

Note that the backup is useful to be obtained on the EnerMaps server, with the `db` container running and containing the integrated datasets. Use `ssh`to connect to the server and then `cd` to `/local/data/enermaps`.
