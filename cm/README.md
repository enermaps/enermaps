Base directory for the calculation modules (cm).

A calculation module is an asynchronous slow task (from seconds to hours of latency for the answer).
A calculation module takes a set of rasters, a selection vector shape and an optional set of parameters

For a non implemented example, see [example_empty](./example_empty) CM.
And for a simple example, see [example_multiply](./example_multiply) CM.

# Create a new cm

Each calculation module is a subdirectory in this directory.

It must contain:
* A setup.cfg symlink to the cm/setup.cfg file. (see
  https://mokacoding.com/blog/symliks-in-git/ for a brief explanation on symbolic links)
* A worker.py entrypoint, this must be an executable that start the worker.
* A test.py unittest testing the calculation without service dependencies (see
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html for explination about unittest library).
* A schema.json jsonschema which describes the schema used for the input parameters (if applicable).
  You can find additional information about jsonschema
  (see https://json-schema.org/).
* A requirements.txt including cm specific dependencies.
* A Dockerfile to create the necessary docker image.
  The docker-compose will need to be modified accordingly to create the new image.
* A python script relating to the cm code.
* A readme file describing the cm operation.

Below is an example of the tree structure :

```bash
─── cm
    └── new_cm
        ├── setup.cfg
        ├── worker.py
        ├── test.py
        ├── schema.json
        ├── requirements.txt
        ├── Dockerfile
        ├── cm_script.py
        └── README.md
```

Once the calculation module is created, it appears on the front-end.
The name of the calculation module that appears depends on the function name decorated in the worker file.

For example:
* for the example_multiply module, the function name is "multiply_raster" and becomes "Multiply raster" at the front-end.
* for the example_empty module, the function name is "new_cm" and becomes "New cm" on the front-end.

## Setup.cfg

Below is the setup file configuration.

```
[flake8]
max-line-length=88
[isort]
line_length=88
```

To keep consistency in the project,
the following parameters mustn't be changed.

## Worker.py

Below is an example of the broker implementation.

````python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import BaseCM.cm_base as cm_base
from BaseCM.cm_output import validate
from cm_script import process


app = cm_base.get_default_app(name="queue_name")
schema_path = cm_base.get_default_schema_path()


@app.task(base=cm_base.CMBase, bind=True, schema_path=schema_path)
def fun(self, selection: dict, rasters: list, params: dict):
    """New cm description"""
    # Validate the raster used
    if not rasters:
        raise ValueError("Raster list must be non-empty.")
    # Validate the selection used
    if "features" not in selection:
        raise ValueError("The selection must be a feature set.")
    if not selection["features"]:
        raise ValueError("The selection must be non-empty.")
    # Validate the parameters used
    self.validate_params(params)

    result = process(selection, rasters, params)

    validate(result)

    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    cm_base.start_app(app)
````

A broker manages the requests made to the calculation module.
The requests made to a calculation module are placed in a queue and each calculation
module has its own queue.
This queue is identified by a name given by the `get_default_app` function.

The selected area (a geojson file) and the selected raster (a geotiff file)
are in the variable ```selection``` and ```rasters``` respectively.

See [test data](./multiply/testdata) for geojson file and geotiff file example.

The variable ```params``` refers to the data provided by the form on the frontend.
The method ```validate_params``` verifies if the values entered by the user match with the schema
of the ```schema.json``` file, see "schema.json" section below.

All CM provide an output dictionary. The 3 keys required are as follows:

* graphs
* geofiles
* values

The schema of this dictionary has to be validated before it is sent to the frontend.
See [cm_output.py](./base/BaseCM/cm_output.py) for more information about the output json schema.

Warning: the name of the function in the `worker.py` file corresponds to the name of the CM as it will appear in the front-end. Make sure that this name is unique, otherwise it will generate conflicts with other CMs.

## Test.py

To perform unit tests on CMs, we use the Unittest library.
For this, we define a class dependent on the Unittest.TestCase class.
In this class are functions that test a particular functionality of the CM.

Pre-implemented methods make it possible to study the behaviour of the CM quite easily.
Below is a non-exhaustive list of these methods:

| Method                    | Checks that
|---------------------------|----------------------
| assertEqual(a, b)         | a == b
| assertNotEqual(a, b)      | a != b
| assertTrue(x)             | bool(x) is True
| assertFalse(x)            | bool(x) is False
| assertIs(a, b)            | a is b
| assertIsNot(a, b)         | a is not b
| assertIsNone(x)           | x is None
| assertIsNotNone(x)        | x is not None
| assertIn(a, b)            | a in b
| assertNotIn(a, b)         | a not in b
| assertIsInstance(a, b)    | isinstance(a, b)
| assertNotIsInstance(a, b) | not isinstance(a, b)

See [unittest documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods)
for more information.

Below is an example of cm test.

```python
import unittest

from cm_script import process

selection = "selection.shp"
raster = "raster.tif"
params = 10

class TestNewCM(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_new_cm_feature(self):
        result = process(selection, rasters, params)
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

## Schema.json

The calculation module form is built thanks to a JSON file using `org.brutusin:json-forms`,
a javascript library.

Below is an example of the data schema expected by the library to build the form.

```
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "factor": {
      "type": "number",
      "default": 1
    }
  }
}
```

As shown in the example above, generally the data entered by the user is numerical data
(see [documentation on JSON numeric variable type](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html)),
but other types of data are supported by JSON schemas (see [documentation on JSON variable types]
(https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/)).

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/brutusin/json-forms) or
[the demo website](http://brutusin.org/json-forms/) of the project for more information.


NB : As mentioned above, this file refers to the optional input parameter `params` in the worker.py file.

## Requirements.txt

Below is an example of the dependencies used by a cm.

```
lxml==4.6.2
GDAL==3.0.4
```

Only the dependencies specific to the cm are to be mentioned in the requirements.txt.

The dependencies below will be available for all cm.

````
marshmallow==3.9.1
marshmallow-union==0.1.15.post1
jsonschema==3.2.0
celery==5.0.2
redis==3.5.3
requests
````

Whenever possible, it is preferable to specify
the version of the dependency used.

## Docker

### Dockerfile

Below is an example of a Dockerfile

```
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get --yes install python3 python3-pip &&\
    rm -rf /var/cache/apt/archives/
WORKDIR cm-new_cm
COPY new_cm/requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
COPY base /tmp/base
RUN cd /tmp/base && pip3 install . && python3 test.py
COPY new_cm .
RUN python3 test.py
CMD ["python3", "worker.py"]
```

### Docker-compose

After adding those entrypoint, you can add your calculation module in the docker-compose.yml file at the root of this directory.


Below is an example of the creation of the new service.

```
cm-new_cm:
  build:
    context: ./cm
    dockerfile: new_cm/Dockerfile
  environment:
    WMS_CACHE_DIR: /wms_cache
  volumes:
    - wms_cache:/wms_cache
  env_file:
    .env
```

## cm_script.py

This python script file contains all the functions that make the CM work.
If the need arises, it is possible to organise these functions in directories.
But, to keep the structure the same throughout each CM, it is recommended to keep
a main function in a separate file at the root of the CM directory
(as shown in first section or in the [example_multiply](./example_multiply) folder).

It is also important to note that before running CM, we need to check that the selection made
contains non-null pixels and at most a maximum number of pixels.

For this purpose the function `validate_selection` has been developed.
The script for this function can be found in the [cm_input.py](./base/BaseCM/cm_input.py) file.
If, for some reason, this function does not work for you, it is up to each CM developer to develop
a function compatible with the CM in question.

# Post geofile

In case a CM would like to post a goofile to API, this is possible.
To do so, we strongly encourage you to use the function in the [base/BaseCM/cm_output.py](./base/BaseCM/cm_output.py) folder.

```python
# get the api url
API_URL = os.environ.get("API_URL")

def output_raster(raster_name, raster_fd):
    """Add a raster to the api"""
    files = {"file": (raster_name, raster_fd, "image/tiff")}
    resp = requests.post(API_URL + "api/geofile/", files=files)
    return resp.ok
```

def output_raster(raster_name, raster_fd):
    """Add a raster to the api"""
    files = {"file": (raster_name, raster_fd, "image/tiff")}
    resp = requests.post(API_URL + "api/geofile/", files=files)
    return resp.ok

At the moment, only Geotiff is supported.

# Test a cm

Currently to test a particular cm, you will need to first start enermaps using `docker-compose up` in the root directory.
Then you can connect to the redis queue. The multiply cm is given as an example.

We strongly encourage you to write unittest that verify the good working of a calculation module
and separated from the enermaps api.

# CMs interaction

Currently, the cm registers on the redis queue through the celery library.
A helper library is given, you can find it under [base/BaseCM/ ](./base/BaseCM)
and an example is given in
[multiply/](./multiply).

# Track building errors

If the new CM isn't built correctly we can track the error with this Docker command :

```
docker-compose logs [SERVICE]
```

This command has to be launched from the enermaps directory.
And the name of the service has to be the same as in the docker-composes file.

See [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/logs/) for more information
about the options.
