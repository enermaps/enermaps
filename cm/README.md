Base directory for the calculation modules (cm).

A calculation module is an asynchronous slow task (from seconds to hours of latency for the answer). 
A calculation module takes a set of rasters, a selection vector shape and an optional set of parameters

# Create a new cm

Each calculation module is a subdirectory in this directory.

It must contain:
* A setup.cfg symlink to the cm/setup.cfg file. (see
  https://mokacoding.com/blog/symliks-in-git/ for a brief explanation on symbolic links)
* A worker.py entrypoint, this must be an executable that start the worker.
* A test.py unittest testing the calculation without service dependencies (see 
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html for explination about unittest library).
* A schema.json jsonschema which describes the schema used for the input parameters (if applicable). 
  You can find additional information about jsonschema
  (see https://json-schema.org/).
* A requirements.txt including cm specific dependencies.
* A Dockerfile to create the necessary docker image.
  The docker-compose will need to be modified accordingly to create the new image.
* A python script relating to the cm code.
* A readme file describing the cm operation.

Below is an example of the tree structure :

```bash
─── cm
    └── new_cm
        ├── setup.cfg
        ├── worker.py
        ├── test.py
        ├── schema.json
        ├── requirements.txt
        ├── Dockerfile
        ├── cm_script.py
        └── README.md
```


## Setup.cfg

Below is the setup file configuration.

```
[flake8]
max-line-length=88
[isort]
line_length=88
```

To keep consistency in the project, 
the following parameters mustn't be changed.

## Worker.py

Below is an example of the broker implementation.

````python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import BaseCM.cm_base as cm_base

from cm_script import process


app = cm_base.get_default_app()
schema_path = cm_base.get_default_schema_path()


@app.task(base=cm_base.CMBase, bind=True, schema_path=schema_path)
def fun(self, selection: dict, rasters: list, params: dict):
    """New cm description"""
    result = process(selection, rasters, params)
    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    cm_base.start_app(app)
````

The selected area (a geojson file) and the selected raster (a geotiff file)
are in the variable ```selection``` and ```rasters``` respectively.

See [test data](./multiply/testdata) for geojson file and geotiff file example.

The variable ```params``` refers to the data provided by the form on the frontend.

All CM provide a output dictionary. The 3 keys required are as follows:

* graphs 
* geofiles
* values

See [cm_output.py](./base/BaseCM/cm_output.py) for more information about the output json schema.

## Test.py

To perform unit tests on CMs, we use the Unittest library.
For this, we define a class dependent on the Unittest.TestCase class. 
In this class are functions that test a particular functionality of the CM.

Pre-implemented methods make it possible to study the behaviour of the CM quite easily.
Below is a non-exhaustive list of these methods:

| Method                    | Checks that           
|---------------------------|----------------------
| assertEqual(a, b)         | a == b                       
| assertNotEqual(a, b)      | a != b                       
| assertTrue(x)             | bool(x) is True              
| assertFalse(x)            | bool(x) is False             
| assertIs(a, b)            | a is b                   
| assertIsNot(a, b)         | a is not b               
| assertIsNone(x)           | x is None            
| assertIsNotNone(x)        | x is not None        
| assertIn(a, b)            | a in b               
| assertNotIn(a, b)         | a not in b           
| assertIsInstance(a, b)    | isinstance(a, b)     
| assertNotIsInstance(a, b) | not isinstance(a, b) 

See [unittest documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods)
for more information.

Below is an example of cm test.

```python
import unittest

from cm_script import process

selection = "selection.shp"
raster = "raster.tif"
params = 10

class TestNewCM(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_new_cm_feature(self):
        result = process(selection, rasters, params)
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

## Schema.json

Below is an example of the data schema expected by the cm.

```
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "factor": {
      "type": "number",
      "default": 1
    }
  }
}
```

As mentioned above, this file refers to the optional input parameter `params` in the worker.py file.

## Requirements.txt

Below is an example of the dependencies used by a cm.

```
lxml==4.6.2
GDAL==3.0.4
```

Only the dependencies specific to the cm are to be mentioned in the requirements.txt.

The dependencies below will be available for all cm.

````
marshmallow==3.9.1
marshmallow-union==0.1.15.post1
jsonschema==3.2.0
celery==5.0.2
redis==3.5.3
requests
````

Whenever possible, it is preferable to specify 
the version of the dependency used. 

## Docker

### Dockerfile

Below is an example of a Dockerfile

```
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get --yes install python3 python3-pip &&\
    rm -rf /var/cache/apt/archives/
WORKDIR cm-new_cm
COPY new_cm/requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
COPY base /tmp/base
RUN cd /tmp/base && pip3 install . && python3 test.py
COPY new_cm .
RUN python3 test.py
CMD ["python3", "worker.py"]
```

### Docker-compose

After adding those entrypoint, you can add your calculation module in the docker-compose.yml file at the root of this directory.


Below is an example of the creation of the new service.

```
cm-new_cm:
  build:
    context: ./cm
    dockerfile: new_cm/Dockerfile
  environment:
    UPLOAD_DIR: /upload-dir
  volumes:
    - upload-data:/upload-dir
  env_file:
    .env
```
# Post geofile

In case a CM would like to post a goofile to API, this is possible.
To do so, we strongly encourage you to use the function in the [base/BaseCM/cm_output.py](./base/BaseCM/cm_output.py) folder.

```python
# get the api url
API_URL = os.environ.get("API_URL")

def output_raster(raster_name, raster_fd):
    """Add a raster to the api"""
    files = {"file": (raster_name, raster_fd, "image/tiff")}
    resp = requests.post(API_URL + "api/geofile/", files=files)
    return resp.ok
```

def output_raster(raster_name, raster_fd):
    """Add a raster to the api"""
    files = {"file": (raster_name, raster_fd, "image/tiff")}
    resp = requests.post(API_URL + "api/geofile/", files=files)
    return resp.ok

At the moment, only Geotiff is supported.

# Test a cm

Currently to test a particular cm, you will need to first start enermaps using `docker-compose up` in the root directory.
Then you can connect to the redis queue. The multiply cm is given as an example.

We strongly encourage you to write unittest that verify the good working of a calculation module 
and separated from the enermaps api.

# CMs interaction

Currently, the cm registers on the redis queue through the celery library.
A helper library is given, you can find it under [base/BaseCM/ ](./base/BaseCM)
and an example is given in
[multiply/](./multiply).

# Track building errors

If the new CM isn't built correctly we can track the error with this Docker command :

```
docker-compose logs [SERVICE]
```

This command has to be launched from the enermaps directory.
And the name of the service has to be the same as in the docker-composes file.

See [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/logs/) for more information
about the options.
