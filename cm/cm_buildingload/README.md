# CM - Building Heating and Cooling Load


## Objective
This calculation module (CM) allows users to simulate hourly space heating and cooling demand profiles for a user-configured building in a user-defined location.


## How it works

The calculation module Building Heating and Cooling Load takes a different approach to many of the other calculation modules included in EnerMaps (and HotMaps). 
Rather than focusing on aggregated data for a region, this CM allows users to assess how differing climate conditions and building typologies can affect 
space heating and cooling demand potential for a specific point (in this case, representing the location for a building). 
Using the granular climate data provided by Copernicus and typical, country-specific building typologies identified by Tabula, 
the CM allows users to design a simple residential building and then assess the hourly heating and cooling demands over a specified period. 
The results from this calculation module are useful for those interested in understanding how regional differences in climate and building standards 
can affect heating and cooling demand at the building level and can also be used to create a heating/cooling energy demand input file for other modeling activities.

## Prerequisite

EnerMaps has to be launched.
If this is not yet the case, see [the general README](../../README.md) to find out how to do so.

Once EnerMaps launched, the frontend should be available on this adress : http://127.0.0.1:7000.

The API key of the PostgREST API must be placed in a text file `cm/heatlearn/API_KEY.txt`.
